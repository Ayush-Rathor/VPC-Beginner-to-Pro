🌩️ Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Overview  
- A VPC is a virtual private cloud: essentially a virtual data center in the Cloud.  
- 🌐 Amazon VPCs are virtual networks within a single AWS Region.  
- 📦 They define boundaries for AWS services/resources and their communication with external networks.  
- 🌍 Supports hybrid cloud configurations (e.g., linking a VPC to an on-premises data center).

 🛠️ Types of VPCs  
 1. Default Amazon VPC  
- 🆓 Created automatically in each AWS Region when an AWS account is created.  
- ⚡ Allows you to start deploying resources without configuring the network.  
- 📜 Features:  
  - 🌐 Public subnets in each Availability Zone (AZ).  
  - ↔️ Default route for inbound/outbound traffic to the internet.  
  - 🚫 No isolation or privacy by default.  
  - 🔢 One default CIDR range per Region (e.g., `172.31.0.0/16`).  
  - 🛡️ Auto-configured with subnets across AZs for resilience.  
  - 📋 Each subnet:  
    - Uses a unique, non-overlapping IP range from the VPC's CIDR.  
    - Fails along with its associated AZ, but other AZs remain functional.  
  - IPv6 CIDR: `/64` for subnets, `/56` for VPCs.

 2. Custom Amazon VPC  
- 🛡️ Fully customizable and logically isolated.  
- 🧩 Features:  
  - Explicit configuration required for all components.  
  - 🔢 CIDR blocks (IPv4/IPv6) must be chosen during creation and cannot be changed later.  
  - ⚙️ Supports adjustable subnets, routing, and endpoints.  
  - 🌐 Provides full control over:  
    - IP address ranges.  
    - Internal traffic flow.  
    - Entry/exit traffic via route tables and gateways.  
  - 🛡️ Configurable security layers (e.g., ACLs, security groups).  
- 🏢 Can connect securely to on-premises networks via:  
  - 🌐 AWS Direct Connect.  
  - 🔗 AWS Site-to-Site VPN.  
  - 📱 AWS Client VPN.  
- 🏗️ Tenancy Options:  
  - Default Tenancy: Shared hardware (cost-effective).  
  - Dedicated Tenancy: Exclusive hardware (higher cost, cannot be changed later).

 🔍 Default vs. Custom Amazon VPC  

| Feature               | Default VPC                                        | Custom VPC                                 |  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| 🛠️ Setup             | Pre-configured by AWS.                              | Fully customizable by the user.            |  
| 🌐 Connectivity      | Internet access by default.                         | Explicit configuration required.           |  
| 🔢 CIDR Range        | Fixed (`172.31.0.0/16`).                            | Flexible (e.g., `/16` to `/28`).           |  
| 🧱 Isolation         | No isolation by default.                            | Full isolation by design.                  |  
| ⚙️ Tenancy           | Not configurable.                                   | Default or Dedicated (chosen at creation). |  
| 🌍 Hybrid Support    | Limited (basic networking).                         | Advanced (Direct Connect, VPN).            |
